= Description =

Tests for the cache coherency implemented in or1200mp.

= Folder Layout =

* verilog: verilog sources for the cache tests and additional components
* sim: contains verilator simulation
* sw: contains the testing software
* syn: contains synthesis files
   * boards/$BOARD: structuring of FPGA boards tested
      * board.v: Board description, such as RESET_ACTIVE_LOW etc.
      * $BOARD.ucf: Constraints file for the board setup
      * nodc,nocoherency,invalidation,update: Test cases
         * or1200_config.v: Core configuration
         * further board/synthesizer specific files

= How to build =

Further description can be found in the corresponding synthesis and simulation folders.
